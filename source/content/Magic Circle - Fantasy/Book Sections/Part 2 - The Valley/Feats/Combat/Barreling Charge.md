**Description** - [[Stride]], attempting to move through enemies's space, and make an [[Athletics]] [[Skill Roll]]. You can pass through any enemies in your trajectory whose [[Athletics]] [[Rank Difficulty]] you surpass, stopping your movement before entering the space of the first enemy whose [[Athletics]] [[Rank Difficulty]] you do not surpass. You can make a [[Melee Strike]] against any creature in [[Reach]] during your movement. You can use [[Barreling Charge]] to [[Burrow]], [[Climb]], [[Fly]], or [[Swim]] instead of Stride if you have the corresponding movement type.
