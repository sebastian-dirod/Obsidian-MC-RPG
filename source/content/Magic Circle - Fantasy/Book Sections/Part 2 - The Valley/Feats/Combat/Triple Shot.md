**Description** - When you use [[Double Shot]], you can make the attacks against the same target. You can add an additional action to [[Double Shot]] to make three [[Ranged Strikes]] instead of two. If you do, the [[Damage Penalty]] is –4. All attacks count toward your [[Repeated Action Penalty]], but the penalty doesn’t increase until after you’ve made all of them.
