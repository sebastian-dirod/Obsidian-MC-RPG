**Description** - When you have a [[Shield]] raised, you can use your [[Shield Block]] reaction when an [[Attack]] is made against an ally adjacent to you. If you do, the shield prevents that ally from taking damage instead of preventing you from taking damage, following the normal rules for [[Shield Block]].
