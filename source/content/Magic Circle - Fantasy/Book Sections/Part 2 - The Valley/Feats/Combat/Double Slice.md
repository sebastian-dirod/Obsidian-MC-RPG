**Requirements** - You are wielding two [[Melee Weapon]]s, each in a different hand.

**Description** - Make two [[Melee Strike]]s, one with each of your two [[Melee Weapon]]s, each using your current [[Repeated Action Penalty]]. Both [[Strike]]s must have the same Target. If the second [[Strike]] is made with a weapon that doesnâ€™t have [[Agile]], [[Finesse]] or [[Light]] trait, this [[Strike]] suffers a [[Damage Penalty]] -2. 

If both [[Strike]]s [[Hit]], combine Total Damage from both [[Strike]]s and apply [[Resistance]]s and [[Weakness]]es only once. This counts as two [[Strike]]s for [[Repeated Action Penalty]].
