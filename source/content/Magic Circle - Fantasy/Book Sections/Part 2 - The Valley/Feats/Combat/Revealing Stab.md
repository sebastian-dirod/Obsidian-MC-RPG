**Feat Tags** - [[Strike]]
**Prerequisites** - None.

**Action Cost** - [[Action 2]]

**Requirements** - You are wielding a [[Melee Weapon]] that can deal [[Piercing]] damage.

**Description** - Make a [[Melee Strike]] with a [[Piercing]] [[Melee Weapon]]. If the target is [[Concealed]], you don’t need to attempt to detect the Target to [[Strike]], and if it’s [[Hidden]], you need to succeed on an [[Observe]] [[Skill Roll]] with an Easy (7) [[Rank Difficulty]].

On a [[Hit]], you can lodge your [[Weapon]] on the Target, if [[Corporeal]], and [[Reveal]] their current position. You [[Release]] the [[Weapon]], and it becomes lodged in the target. If the target is [[Concealed]], no attempt to detect them is needed to target them, and if it’s [[Hidden]], the [[Rank Difficulty]] to target them is Easy (7), and the Target can’t become [[Undetected]]. These benefits apply only to those who can see your weapon stuck in the Target. If the Target is [[Invisible]], the [[Weapon]] remains [[Visible]] while lodged in it.

This benefit lasts until the [[Weapon]] is removed from the Target. An adjacent creature or the Target can remove the [[Weapon]] with two [[Interact]] actions.
