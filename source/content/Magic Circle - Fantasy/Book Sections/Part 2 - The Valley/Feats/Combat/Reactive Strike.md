**Trigger** - Target within your [[Reach]] uses a [[Manipulate]] action or a [[Move]] action, makes a [[Ranged Strike]], or leaves a square during a [[Move]] action it's using.

**Description** - Make a [[Melee Strike]] against the triggering target. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a [[Manipulate]] action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your [[Repeated Action Penalty]] for the [[Strike]] action, and your [[Repeated Action Penalty]]  doesn't apply to this [[Strike]].
