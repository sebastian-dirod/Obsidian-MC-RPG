**Feat Tags** - [[Stance]]
**Prerequisites** - None.

**Action Cost** - [[Action 1]]

**Description** - While you are in this [[Stance]], any [[Toss]] or [[Thrown]] [[Weapon]]s you use as part of a [[Ranged Strike]] to deal [[Bludgeoning]] or [[Slashing]] damage immediately return to your hand, enabling you to use them for additional [[Strikes]]. You must be within the weaponâ€™s First [[Range]] and have a hand free to catch the weapon. If you make a [[Ranged Strike]] with a [[Toss]] or [[Thrown]] [[Weapon]] outside of its First [[Range]], it instead flies back toward you a number of feet equal to its First [[Range]] and then falls to the ground.
