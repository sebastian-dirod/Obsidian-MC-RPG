**Feat Tags** - [[Strike]] [[Maneuver]]
**Prerequisites** - Requires [[Slam Down]]

**Action Cost** - [[Feature]]

**Description** - When you use [[Slam Down]], instead of making a Strike followed by a Trip, you can attempt a single Strike. On a [[Hit]], you automatically apply the [[Critical Success]] effect of a [[Trip]]. If you used a  [[Two Handed]] [[Melee Weapon]] for the [[Strike]], you can use  your [[Weapon Mastery Skill]] [[Skill Rank]] instead of the damage from a critical [[Trip]] as [[Trip]]'s damage.
