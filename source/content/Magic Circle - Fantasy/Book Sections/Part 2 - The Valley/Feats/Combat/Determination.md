**Feat Tags** - [[Resist]] [[Withstand]] [[Concentrate]]
**Prerequisites** - None.

**Action Cost** - [[Action 1]]

**Frequency** - Frequency once per day.

**Description** - Choose a single non-permanent condition, spell, or magical effect that is affecting you. If you chose a condition, its effect on you ends. If you chose a spell or other magical effect, attempt to counteract the spell (your [[Counteract Rank]] is equal to half your [[Character Rank]], rounded up, and you attempt a [[Withstand]] [[Skill Roll]] as your [[Counteract]] check).

This doesn’t remove any damage you already took from the spell or condition, and it removes the effect from only you, not from other creatures or the environment around you. It can’t remove an ongoing affliction or prevent such an affliction from inflicting conditions on you later. It can’t remove conditions occurring automatically due to your situation or positioning (such as prone or flanked).
