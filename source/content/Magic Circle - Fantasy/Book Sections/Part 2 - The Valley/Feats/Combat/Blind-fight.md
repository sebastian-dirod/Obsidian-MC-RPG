You don’t need to attempt to detect the Target to [[Strike]], and if it’s [[Hidden]], you need to succeed on an [[Observe]] [[Skill Roll]] with an Easy (7) [[Rank Difficulty]].

**Description** - You don’t need to attempt to detect [[Concealed]] creatures to target them. You’re not [[Off-Guard]] to [[Hidden]] creatures (unless you’re [[Off-Guard]] to them for reasons other than the [[Hidden]] condition), and you need only to succeed on an [[Observe]] [[Skill Roll]] with an Easy (7) [[Rank Difficulty]] to target a [[Hidden]] creature.

While you’re adjacent to an [[Undetected]] creature of your level or lower, it is instead only [[Hidden]] from you.
