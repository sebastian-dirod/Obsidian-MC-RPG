**Requirements** - You are wielding a [[Ranged Weapon]] without [[Reload]] trait or with [[Reload]] 0.

**Description** - You fire a volley at all foes in an area. Make one [[Strike]] with a [[Damage Penalty]] –2 against each enemy within a 2-step-radius burst centered at or beyond your [[Weapon]]’s [[Volley]] [[Range]].

Each [[Strike]] counts toward your [[Repeated Action Penalty]], but do not increase your penalty until you have made all your [[Strike]]s.

(It could count as one Strike per enemy if we decide to go for the version of one strike and compare to enemies Evasion).
