# Playing The Game

## Skills & Challenges
- What is a Skill
- What is a Test --> Skill Roll
- What is a Challenge --> Skill Rank Roll
- Experience is transformed into Skill Points on Rest.
- You can spent any left Skill Points when taking Rest.

### Skill Rank & The D6s
> What dice we use and how many

### Skill Rolls & Skill Rank Rolls
*Skill Roll* --> roll D6s vs. DC, you get output

*Rank Roll* --> roll D6s vs. Flat DC, each D6 > Flat DC = +1 Success, Rank = nº Successes needed to achieve goal. Flat DC is defined by NPC or Narrator
- If Skill Rank > Rank DC, you can sum results of several D6s against smaller nº of Successes
- If Skill Rank < Rank DC, each Rank DC above Skill Rank is a Failure automatically
- Flat DC of NPC  varies depending on the Challenge
	- NPC Skill Rank, with Flat DC = Character Rank

#### Pushing A Roll
- Try again, but consequences get worse

#### Danger Clock and Twists
- From Blades in the Dark's Flashback mechanic
- Requires using Danger Clock as a mechanic in the game
- Go up Degree of Success up to Success (1 for Failure, 2 for Critical Failure)
- For each Degree of Success, add 1 Tick to the Danger Clock
- If Roll has been pushed, add another Tick to the Danger Clock
- Danger Clock is a Clock that, when fulfilled, a Menace, a Death is at the Table or an Obligation is Triggered or delayed until Narrator wants.

### Rolling Against Clock
- Challenge Clock Time Units = Challenge Rank
- Nº Successes Required = Challenge Clock Time Units. Rolls continue until Clock Filled
- Flat DC = Difficulty
	- Difficulty = 1 to 10
	- Difficulty = <1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14>, adding max. attr
	- Difficulty = <1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10>, adding avg. attr
- If Time Limit & Challenge Clock unfilled, Challenge Failed. Every roll = 1 Time Unit
- Clock Description = (Name, Rank, Difficulty, Time Units, Time Limit)
