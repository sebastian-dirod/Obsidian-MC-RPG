##### Player Roles
- Roles in Play (Storyteller and Actors)
	- Narrator Role - Definition
	- Actor Role - Definition

##### The Play
- Cycles of Establish Context (DM) & Act (Player) - Context, Decisions, Consequences
	- DM describes the environment
	- Player describes their decision/action
		- Taking turns to describe actions
		- Relying on the dice for the output
	- DM describes results of Player's actions (the consequence)

Example:
This system uses D6 dice pools to determine the results of any action. The dice pool is determined by the Prowess of the Character for a determined skill, and the situational dice that affect the action.

The situational dice can be a combination of positive and negative conditions, that cancel each other 1-to-1: if there are 6 positive dice, and 3 negative dice, the situational dice are +3 positive dice; if there are 3 negative dice and 1 positive dice, the situational dice are +2 negative dice.

To get the result of the roll, the player needs to add up a number of dice equal to the Prowess rank on the skill they are using for the action. If there are any negative situationalÂ  dice in the roll, the player has to add up the lowest dice from the pool. They have to add up the highest dice in from the pool otherwise.

If the Character has a Prowess rank of 0 in a Skill they are trying to use, they use a Prowess of 1, and add a situational negative die to the roll.

Example
Character has a Prowess Rank of 3 on the skill, 2 positive situational dice, and 3 negative situational dice, and the Stat used for the roll has a bonus of +2. They have to roll 3D6 due to Prowess, and another D6 due to the situation, for a final roll of 4D6.

They roll and get 6, 3, 4, 3 as the dice result. As they have 1 negative dice in the pool, the have to choose the lowest, and as they have a Prowess of 3, they have to add up the 3 lowest from the pool (3, 4, 3), for a final result of 3+4+3+2 = 12.

Example
A Character has Prowess 0 and a Stat of +1. Due to the situation, they add 2 positive dice to the roll, and due to lack of Prowess, they add 1 negative dice, for a total of 1 situational positive die. They roll 2D6, for a pool of (5, 2). As there is still a positive dice, the result of the roll is 5+1=6.

##### The Dice
D6s, the number is established by proficiency/expertise skill rank, you roll when dm deems appropriate and gives you result

##### Favors & Snubs
- Favors +Xd, drop X lowest, up to five
- Snubs +Xd, drop X highest, up to five
- They cancel each other out, one for one

##### Always Round Up
- If there is any division, you round up, no matter the decimals

##### Specific Beats General
- If there is a rule that is more specific, it overwrites the more general
- Feat is more specific than Action. Action is more specific than Skill.

#### Storytelling in Magic Circle
